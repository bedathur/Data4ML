1. Gao, Ruoyuan and Chirag Shah. “How Fair Can We Go: Detecting the Boundaries of Fairness Optimization in Information Retrieval.” ICTIR (2019).
_although the paper is about fairness, it provides an interesting framework for estimating how much bias exists inherently in the data being used to rerank -- i.e., it develops a way to estimate the upper/lower bounds of achievable fairness. Now, one may consider if a similar approach can be adapted for any LeTOR framework_
